# Mines

Mines is a simplistic [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) clone written in Java.

##### How do I play?

The idea of the game is to safely flag where the mines are. To search a plot, left click it. To flag a plot, right click it. Searching an empty plot will recursively reveal all plots around it, and either clear it completely or tell you how many mines there are in the surrounding plots. Clicking a mined plot results in the player losing the game.

##### Why?

I had never touched UI development in Java, and wanted to get a feel for JavaFX.
